# WP Exit intent popup

Simple plugin wrapper which triggers modal window when it detects user intention to leave your website. Use it to keep your visitors engaged and annoyed :)

## How to use

There are no settings, customize includes/template.php and CSS file as you wish. For example, you can use [WP Mailchimp plugin](https://github.com/marko-stimac/WP-Mailchimp) to add newsletter component there for user subscription.
